<div class="slide-title">`r fontawesome::fa("universal-access", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` What is web accessibility and why is it important?</div>

<p class="body-text">From the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/)'s [Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/):</p>

<div class="quote-text-bg">
<p class="small-text">Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can:</p>
<p class="smaller-text">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web</p>
<p class="smaller-text">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` contribute to the Web</p> 
<p class="small-text">Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including: auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual</p>
<p class="small-text">Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for example:</p>
<p class="smaller-text">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.</p>
<p class="smaller-text">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` older people with changing abilities due to ageing</p>
<p class="smaller-text">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or lost glasses</p>
<p class="smaller-text">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` people with “situational limitations” such as in bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot listen to audio</p>

##  {#hierarchy data-menu-title="Heirarchy"}

<div class="slide-title-smaller">Use HTML elements appropriately</div>

<p class="small-text bottombr">**Screen readers use HTML elements to understand web page organization.** Header elements create hierarchy within a webpage and are used by screen readers (i.e. devices used by those with visual impairments) to understand a page's organizational structure. An `<h1>` element is more important (hierarchically speaking) than an `<h2>`, which is more important than an `<h3>`, and so on.</p>

. . . 

:::: {.columms}

::: {.column width="45%"}
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# load packages ----
library(shiny)

# user interface ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$h1("This is my app's title"),
  
  tags$h2("Section 1"),
  
  tags$h3("Sub-section a"),
  
  tags$h3("Sub-section b"),
  
  tags$h3("Sub-section c"),
  
  tags$h2("Section 2"),

```

<p class="small-text topbr">Ideally, you would only have one `<h1>` element (e.g. your app's **title**), a small number of `<h2>` elements, more `<h3>` elements, and so on. See the minimal example, to the left.</p>

<p class="small-text topbr">You *should not* rely on headers for styling purposes -- for example, you should not use a level-one header elsewhere in your app just because you want larger text. Instead, use CSS to increase text size (refer to the [Customizing Quarto Websites](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-quarto-websites/#/title-slide) workshop for [instruction on how to construct CSS selectors](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-quarto-websites/#/selector-types) for styling HTML elements).</p>

##  {#alt-text data-menu-title="Alt text"}

<div class="slide-title-smaller">Include alt text with all graphical elements</div>

<p class="body-text bottombr">All images and graphical elements should include **alternative (alt) text** that describe the image and/or information being represented. This text won't appear in the UI, but is detected and read by screen readers. A good rule of thumb for writing alt text for for data visualizations is <em>alt="<span style="background-color: #F9C9C8;">Chart type</span> of <span style="background-color: #FDC790;">type of data</span> where <span style="background-color: #D1EAEE;">reason for including chart</span>"</em> (read more in [this post](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81#:~:text=Alt%20text%20) by [Amy Cesal](https://www.amycesal.com/)).</p>

. . . 

<p class="small-text">Include the `alt` argument (similar to adding the `alt` attribute to an HTML element) when using [`renderPlot()`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.7.1/renderplot) to add alt text to your reactive plots -- the `alt` argument lives *outside* of the `{}` but inside the `()`. For example:</p>

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# in your server
renderPlot({

    ggplot(data(), aes(x = var1, y = var2)) + 
      geom_point() 
    
  }, alt = "Alt text description"
  
  )
```

. . . 

<p class="small-text">Similarly, use the `alt` argument within `tags$img` when adding static images to your app. For example:</p>

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# in your UI
tags$img(src = "file/path/to/img",
         width = "100px", height = "100px",
         alt = "Alt text for image")
```

<p class="small-text topbr">For some great tips on how and when to use alt text, check out this article by the [A11Y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/alt-text/). For examples of how to construct good alt text, take a peek at this resource by [Datawrapper](https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/330-how-to-write-good-alternative-descriptions-for-your-data-visualization).</p>

##  {#color-palettes data-menu-title="Color Palettes"}

<div class="slide-title">Use colorblind-friendly palettes</div>

<p class="small-text">About 1 in 12 males and 1 in 200 females have some form of colorblindness ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness)). Ensuring that your color choices are distinguishable from one another and/or providing an additional non-color-based way (e.g. patterns, shapes) of distinguishing between treatments/variables/etc. can greatly help with interpretation of data visualizations.</p>

<p class="small-text">There are lots of great colorblind-accessible palettes and resources (check out [this one](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2022-06/Colorblind%20Safe%20Color%20Schemes.pdf) by [Alex Phillips](https://www.alexandraatleephillips.com/) to start). Google Chrome also has a built-in vision deficiency emulator (see gif, below right; right click in your web browser > Inspect > Rendering (add tab by clicking on the three stacked dots if it's not already open) > scroll down and choose emulation type from drop down where it says "Emulate vision deficiencies").</p>
