##  {#why-test data-menu-title="Why test?"}

<div class="slide-title">Why test our Shiny apps?</div>

<p class="body-text">It's almost inevitable that apps will break -- there are lots of reasons why this happens, but to name a few:</p>

. . . 

<p class="small-text topbr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` an upgraded R package(s) has a different behavior (this includes `shiny`) -- this is especially relevant for those apps hosted on servers, where server software (including packages) may be updated by system administrators</p>

. . . 

<p class="small-text topbr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` you make changes to your app</p>

. . . 

<p class="small-text topbr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` an external data source stops working or returns data in a different format than expected by your app</p>

. . .

<p class="body-text topbr">It can save a lot of time and headache to have an automated system that checks if your app is working as expected.</p>

<p class="small-text quote-text-bg">"*`shinytest2` uses `testthat`’s snapshot-based testing strategy. The first time it runs a set of tests for an application, it performs some scripted interactions with the app and takes one or more snapshots of the application’s state. These snapshots are saved to disk so that future runs of the tests can compare their results to them.*"</p>

##  {#app-for-testing data-menu-title="The app we'll test"}

<div class="slide-title">Let's test the following app</div>

<p class="body-text">This small app accepts a text input for users to type their name. When the "Greet" button is pressed, the app returns a short greeting message that says, "Hello ____!></p>

<p class="body-text">To get started, create a subdirectory called `/testing_app`, add a file named `app.R` and drop this code in your file. Take a moment to try out the app.</p>

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  
  textInput("name", "What is your name?"),
  actionButton("greet", "Greet"),
  textOutput("greeting")
  
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
  output$greeting <- renderText({
    req(input$greet)
    paste0("Hello ", isolate(input$name), "!")
    
  })

##  {#testing-procedure data-menu-title="Testing procedure"}

<div class="slide-title">Testing using `shinytest2`</div>

<p class="body-text">Recording tests requires the following steps:</p>

. . . 

<p class="small-text topbr">**(1)** Run `record_test(<app-directory>)` to launch the app recorder in browser window</p>

. . . 

<p class="small-text topbr">**(2)** Interact with your application and tell the recorder to make an expectation (e.g. an expected value when inputX is updated) on the state at various points</p>

. . . 

<p class="small-text topbr">**(3)** Quit the recorder to save and execute your tests</p>

. . . 

<p class="body-text">To test our app, we'll do the following:</p>

<p class="small-text topbr">**(1)** run `shinytest2::record_test("testing_app")` in the console to launch the recorder in a browser window</p>

<p class="small-text topbr">**(2)** interact with your app by first typing a name (e.g. Sam), then pressing the "Greet" button to display the output text</p>

<p class="small-text topbr">**(3)** click the "Expect Shiny values" button in the recorder app sidebar to set an expectation (this will record inputs, outputs, and exported values)</p>

<p class="small-text topbr">**(4)** give your test a name in the recorder app sidebar, then click "Save test and exit" - this will save the recorded test and setup the testing infrastructure, if it doesn't exit already</p>

##  {#creating-test1-example data-menu-title="Creating our first test"}

<div class="slide-title">Creating our first test</div>

<p class="body-text">Following the steps on the previous slide, creating your test should look similar to this:</p>

<center><img src="images/sam-test.gif" alt="" width="650"/></center>

<p class="body-text">**Note:** Your test is automatically run as soon as you save and exit the recorder. See the results of your test in your console (it should pass!).</p>

---

##  {#test-files-created data-menu-title="Test files created"}

<div class="slide-title">Test files are generated automatically</div>

<p class="body-text">After recording your first test, a `/tests` folder is generated, containing a number of different files and subdirectories. Some important files to note:</p>

::: {.panel-tabset}

## `setup-shinytest2.R`

<p class="small-text">**(located at `<app-directory>/tests/testthat/setup-shinytest2.R`)**; For more complex apps, you'll often have support files (e.g. those contained in `<app-directory>/R` and/or `global.R`) -- content from those files will be stored here so that it is made accessible to your test(s). Since we don't have any support files for our rather small/somewhat simple app, you should only see the following:</p>

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# Load application support files into testing environment
shinytest2::load_app_env()
```

## `test-shinytest2.R`

<p class="small-text">**(located at `<app-directory>/tests/testthat/test-shinytest2.R`)**; This test script contains your recorded test, and should automatically open when you finish recording and save your test. You can manually modify this test (e.g. add additional interactions and expectations), if you wish. Yours should look similar to this:</p>

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
library(shinytest2)

test_that("{shinytest2} recording: sam-test", {
  app <- AppDriver$new(name = "sam-test", height = 509, width = 657)
  app$set_inputs(name = "Sam")
  app$click("greet")
  app$expect_values()
})
```

## `*_.png`

<p class="small-text">**(located at `<app-directory>/tests/testthat/_snaps/shinytest2/*_.png`)**; This is a screenshot of your app from when `app$expect_values()` was called -- this file should be tracked using git so that you know how your app visually changes over time. My `.png` file looks like this:</p>

<center><img src="images/sam-test-001_.png" alt="A screenshot from my app, with the text 'Sam' printed in the text input box beneath the prompt, 'What is your name?'. Below the text box is a button that says 'Greet'. Below that, the text, 'Hello Sam!' is printed." width="450"/></center>

## `*.json`

<p class="small-text">**(located at `<app-directory>/tests/testthat/_snaps/shinytest2/*.json`**); This is a [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) representation of the state of the app when `app$expect_values()` was called -- you'll see the state of all input, output, and export values at the time of the snapshot (we don't have any exports in our example app, but we do have a name input and a greeting output). This file should be tracked with git so that you have a record of your expected results. Your `.json` file should look something like this:</p>

```{json}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
{
  "input": {
    "greet": 1,
    "name": "Sam"
  },
  "output": {
    "greeting": "Hello Sam!"
  },
  "export": {

  }
}
```
