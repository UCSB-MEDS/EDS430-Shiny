<p class="small-text">Shiny is awesome, but depending on your goals, vision, and end users, you may not need the full functionality that shiny provides. You can potentially save yourself (and your clients) the stress of deploying and maintaining apps by first considering other options:</p>

. . . 

<p class="small-text topbr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Widgets aren't only for Shiny! Embed interactive [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/) into your R Markdown documents that range from geo-spatial mapping with `{leaflet}` to generating network graph diagrams with `{DiagrammeR}`. Check out the [htmlwidgets for R](http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/) - gallery for many more options.</p>

. . . 

<p class="small-text topbr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Compose multiple widgets into a dashboard using `{flexdashboard}`. Based in R Markdown, this framework allows you to produce dynamic dashboards using tools you are already familiar with. Find example projects and their source code [here](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/articles/examples.html).</p>

. . . 

<p class="small-text topbr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Embed reactive shiny components (e.g. inputs & outputs) in Quarto documents. By using some fun new code chunk options, you can instruct Quarto to spin up it's own self-contained shiny server to run your reactives. Read the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/shiny/) to learn more and check out some teaching examples [here](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/shiny/#examples).</p>
