##  {#global.R data-menu-title="global.R"}

<div class="slide-title-smaller">A `global.R` file can help you keep code organized</div>

<p class="small-text bottombr">While not a requirement of a shiny app, a `global.R` file will help reduce redundant code, increase your app's speed, and help keep code more clearly organized. It works by running once when your app is first launched, making any logic, objects, etc. contained in it available to both the `ui.R` and `server.R` files (or, in the case of a single-file shiny app, the `app.R` file). It's a great place for things like:</p>

. . . 

<p class="smaller-text">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` loading packages</p>
<p class="smaller-text">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` importing data</p>
<p class="smaller-text">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` sourcing scripts (particularly functions -- we'll talk more about functions later)</p>
<p class="smaller-text">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` data wrangling (though you'll want to do any major data cleaning before bringing your data into your app)</p>

<p class="smaller-text">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` etc.</p>

. . . 

<p class="small-text topbr bottombr">`global.R` *must* be saved to the same directory as your `ui.R` and `server.R` files.</p>

. . . 

<center><p class="medium-body-text">**Exercise:** Create a `global.R` file inside your `/two-file-app` directory and load the `{shiny}` package at the top -- we'll continue to add to this file as we work on our app.</p></center>

##  {#layout-functions data-menu-title="Layout functions"}

<div class="slide-title-smaller">Layout functions provide the high-level visual structure of your app</div>

<p class="small-text">Layouts are created using a **hierarchy** of function calls *inside* `fluidPage()`. Layouts often require a series functions -- **container** functions establish the larger area within which other layout elements are placed. See some minimal examples of these layout functions on the following slide.</p>

<p class="small-text">**Some useful layout function pairings:**</p>
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# sidebar for inputs & main area for outputs within the sidebarLayout() container
sidebarLayout(
  sidebarPanel(),
  mainPanel()
)
# multi-row fluid layout (add any number of fluidRow()s to a fluidPage())
fluidRow(
  column(4, ...),
  column(8, ...)
)
# tabPanel()s to contain HTML components (e.g. inputs/outputs) within the tabsetPanel() container
tabsetPanel(
  tabPanel()
)
# page with top-level navigation bar that can be used to toggle tabPanel() elements
navbarPage(
  tabPanel()
)
```

. . .

<p class="smallest-text">**Note:** Under the hood, `fluidPage()` sets up all the HTML, CSS, and Javascript that Shiny needs. It's a super important function! Therefore, all layout functions are called inside `fluidPage()`. Check out the documentation for `fixedPage()` and `fillPage()` which may be substituted for `fluidPage()` in more specialized situations.</p>

## Sidebar & main area

<p class="body-text">To create a page with a **side bar and main area** to contain your inputs and outputs (respectively), explore the following layout functions and read up on the [sidebarLayout documentation](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.6.0/sidebarlayout):</p>

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
```{r}
#| eval: false

  titlePanel(
    # app title/description
  ),

      # inputs here
    ),

      # outputs here
    )

The titlePanel() function creates a row at the top of the page for a title. The sidebarLayout() function creates a new row below titlePanel(). Within the sidebarLayout(), there are two side-by-side columns created using the sidebarPanel() function (to the left) and the mainPanel() function (to the right)." width="650"/></center>
:::

## Page with multiple rows

<p class="body-text">To create a **page with multiple rows**, explore the following layout functions and check out the [fluid layout](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.6.0/fluidpage) documentation. Note that each row is made up of **12** columns. The first argument of the `column()` function takes a value of 1-12 to specify the number of columns to occupy.</p>

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
fluidPage(
  fluidRow(
    column(4, 
      ...

    column(8, 
      ...
    )
  ),
  fluidRow(
    column(6, 
      ...
    ),
    column(6, 
      ...
    )
  )

Within that, the fluidRow() function is used twice to create two stacked (one atop the other) rows on the page. Within each fluidRow are two side-by-side columns, each created using the column() function. Each row is made up of 12 columns. The column() function takes a value of 1-12 as the first arguement to specify how many of those 12 columns to occupy." width="650"/></center>
:::

## Tabs

<p class="body-text">You may find that you eventually end up with too much content to fit on a single application page. Enter `tabsetPanel()` and `tabPanel()`. `tabsetPanel()` creates a container for any number of `tabPanel()`s. Each `tabPanel()` can contain any number of HTML components (e.g. inputs and outputs). Find the [tabsetPanel documentation here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.5.0/tabsetpanel) and check out this example:</p>

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
tabsetPanel(
  tabPanel("Tab 1", 
    # an input
    # an output
  ),
  tabPanel("Tab 2"),
  tabPanel("Tab 3")
)
```
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
<center><img src="images/tabsetPanel_layout.png" alt="A simplified schematic of a Shiny app with a tabsetPanel layout. The page as a whole is created with the fluidPage() function. Within that, the tabsetPanel() function creates a container within which three tabPanel()s ('Tab 1', 'Tab 2', 'Tab 3') are defined (for this particular example). Tab 1 is highlighted and has placeholder text which says '# an input' and then on the line below, '# an output'." width="650"/></center>
:::

::::

## Navbar

<p class="body-text">You may also want to use a navigation bar (`navbarPage()`) with different pages (created using `tabPanel()`) to organize your application. Read through the [navbarPage documentation](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.6.0/navbarpage) and try running the example below:</p>

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
fluidPage(
  navbarPage(
    "My app",
    tabPanel("Tab 1",
             # an input
             # an output
             ),
    tabPanel("Tab 2")
  )
)  
```

<center><img src="images/navbarPage_layout.png" alt="A simplified schematic of a Shiny app with a navbarPage layout. The page as a whole is created with the fluidPage() function. Within that, the navbarPage() function creates a top-level navigation bar that can be used to toggle between two tabPanel()s ('Tab 1', 'Tab 2'), which are definted for this particular example. Tab 1 is highlighted and has placeholder text which says '# an input' and then on the line below, '# an output'." width="650"/></center>
