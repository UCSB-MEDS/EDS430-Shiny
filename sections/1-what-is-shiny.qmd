<div class="slide-title">Shiny makes building web apps easy</div>

<p class="quote-text-bg body-text bottombr">*"**Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R.** You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/?_ga=2.5356915.1997816511.1640293283-2019993402.1637352626) documents or build [dashboards](http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/?_ga=2.5356915.1997816511.1640293283-2019993402.1637352626). You can also extend your Shiny apps with [CSS themes](http://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/?_ga=2.94499804.1997816511.1640293283-2019993402.1637352626), [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/), and JavaScript [actions.](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs/blob/master/README.md)"* **- RStudio**</p>

The first is a dropdown menu where the user can select a region (e.g. Europe & Central Asia) or view all regions at the same time. The next two widgets are slider inputs -- the first allows the user to select a year between 1960 and 2014, and the second allows the user to select a population size between 500 and 5000. On the right hand side of the app is a bubble plot of Fertility Rate vs. Life Expectancy, which updates as inputs are changed by the user. Hovering a bubble displays thge corresponding Country, Region, Population, Life Expectancy, and Fertility Rate." width="700"/></center>

<div class="slide-title">The basic anatomy of a Shiny app</div>

<p class="body-text bottombr">Shiny apps are composed in *two* parts: (1) a **web page** that displays the app to a user (i.e. the **user interface**, or **UI** for short), and (2) a **computer** that powers the app (i.e. the **server**)</p>

<center><img src="images/basic_shiny_app.png" alt="A simple schematic of a Shiny app, which includes the User Interface (UI, colored in blue) and the Server (colored in orange). The UI creates what the user will see and interact with, while the server builds the outputs that react and update based on user inputs." width="675"/></center>

<p class="body-text bottombr">The **UI** controls the **layout and appearance** of your app and is written in HTML (except we use functions from the `{shiny}` package to write that HTML). The **server** handles the **logic** of the app -- in other words, it is a set of instructions that tells the webpage what to display when a user interacts with it.</p>

<p class="body-text topbr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Shiny comes with a variety of [pre-built widgets](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson3/) (see left), but you can also explore widget extensions using the [`{shinyWidgets}`](https://github.com/dreamRs/shinyWidgets) package.</p>

##  {#reactivity-intro data-menu-title="Reactivity Intro"}

<div class="slide-title">Reactivity: a brief intro</div>

<p class="body-text bottombr">Reactivity is what makes Shiny apps responsive i.e. it lets the app instantly update itself whenever the user makes a change. At a very basic level, it looks something like this:</p>

<center><img src="images/reactivity_intro.png" alt="A schematic of Shiny reactivity. The UI is represented by a light blue box. Inside the blue UI box, there is a radio button widget that says, 'Make a choice:' and three round radio buttons beneath it. Underneath that, there is a placeholder space for a reactive output to be created by the server. The server is to the left of the UI and is represented by an orange box. At a basic level, reactivity occurs after the following steps: (1) A widget gets information from a user which (2) is then passed to the server where it is used to update a data frame based on the users choice. (3) The new data frame is used to update outputs in the server, and (4) those outputs are then rendered in the UI." width="750"/></center>

<p class="small-text bottombr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Check out the available Shiny app examples by running this code in your console:</p>

```{r}

library(shiny)
runExample(example = NA)
```

. . .

<p class="small-text topbr bottombr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` Run the first example, which plots Râ€™s built-in `faithful` data set with a configurable number of bins:</p>

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
runExample("01_hello")
```

<p class="small-text topbr bottombr">Change the number of bins using the `sliderInput` widget and watch the histogram re-render.</p>

<p class="small-text topbr bottombr">`r fontawesome::fa("angle-right", fill = "#05859B", a11y = "sem")` These working examples also come paired with source code for you to see how the app is built. For example, the `sliderInput` is built with the following code:</p>

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# Input: Slider for the number of bins ----
sliderInput(inputId = "bins",
            label = "Number of bins:",
             min = 1,
             max = 50,
