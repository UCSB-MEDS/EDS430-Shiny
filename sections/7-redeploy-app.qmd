<div class="slide-title-smaller bottombr">Redeploying is similar to deploying for the first time</div>

<p class="body-text bottombr">Just a few quick steps before your updates are live at your URL from earlier:</p>

<p class="small-text">**1.** double check to make sure any required packages are being imported in `global.R`</p>
<p class="small-text topbr">**2.** Rerun `rsconnect::deployApp("<app-directory-nam">` in your console and type `Y` when you see the prompt `Update application currently deployed at https://githubUserName.shinyapps.io/yourAppName? [Y/n]`</p>
<p class="small-text topbr">**3.** Give it a minute (or few) to deploy. Your deployed app will open in a browser window once processed</p>
<p class="small-text topbr">**4.** Push all your files (including the `/rsconnect` directory) to GitHub</p>
