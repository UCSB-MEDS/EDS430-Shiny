When any of these actions are taken by the user, all data are removed from the plot, leaving a completely blank box behind.</p>

##  {#using-validate data-menu-title="Using validate()"}

<div class="slide-title">Writing validation tests</div>

<p class="small-text">`validate()` tests a condition and returns an error if that conditions fails. It's used in conjunction with `need()`, which takes an expression that returns `TRUE` or `FALSE`, along with a character string to return if the condition is `FALSE`.</p>

<p class="small-text">Place your validation test(s) at the start of any `reactive()` or `render*()` expression that calls `input$data`. For example, we can add two validation tests inside the reactive that generates our `trout_filtered_df` -- we'll need two separate validation tests, one for each of our inputs where users can deselect all data.</p>

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "6-12"
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # filter for channel types ----
  trout_filtered_df <- reactive({

    validate(
      need(length(input$channel_type_input) > 0, "Please select at least one channel type to visualize data for.")
    )

    validate(
      need(length(input$section_input) > 0, "Please select at least one section (clear cut forest or old growth forest) to visualize data for.")
    )

      clean_trout |>
        filter(channel_type %in% c(input$channel_type_input)) |>
        filter(section %in% c(input$section_input))

##  {#loading-animations data-menu-title="Add loading animations"}

<div class="slide-title-smaller">Add loading animations to re-rendering outputs</div>

<p class="small-text">The [`{shinycssloaders} package](https://github.com/daattali/shinycssloaders) makes it easy to add visual indicators to outputs as they're loading or re-rendering. This can be particularly helpful if you have outputs that take a few seconds to render -- it alerts users that their updated inputs were recognized and that the app is working to re-render outputs.</p>

<p class="small-text">Check out the [demo app](https://daattali.com/shiny/shinycssloaders-demo/) to start designing your own "spinner" (choose style, color, size).</p>

<p class="small-text">We can pipe the `withSpinner()` function directly into our `plotOutput`s in `ui.R` -- here, we define the spinner color and style (there are 8 different spinner `type`s to choose from) and adjust the size of the penguin plot spinner.</p>

##  {#include-alt-text data-menu-title="Include alt text"}

<div class="slide-title-smaller">Include alt text for all data visualizations</div>

<p class="small-text">Alt text are **written descriptions** added to images, and importantly, to data visualizations, to **help more users understand the content**. Assistive technologies (e.g. screen readers) read alt text out loud for users to hear. When alt text is successfully added, the `alt` tag (along your text) should appear in the HTML (right click on your app's data viz to **Inpsect** and ensure that it was added).</p>

<br>

<p class="small-text">We'll talk a bit more about alt text [later on](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/EDS430-Shiny/#/alt-text), but for now we can add alt text easily to our data visuzliations using the `alt` argument. Place this *outside* of the `{}` but inside the `()` of `renderPlot{()}`. For example, we can add alt text to our trout and penguin plots in `server.R`:</p>
